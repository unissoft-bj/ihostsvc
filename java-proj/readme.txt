repo for java project.
aar: android audio record project
wms: wifi matrix system, spring boot project running on ihost.

the aar project should be imported into android studio for development purpose.
Here is the tip for using github with android studio:
Open the project you want to push in Android Studio.

Click VCS -> Enable version Control Integration -> Git

There doesn't seem to be a way to add a remote through the GUI. So open Git Bash in the root of the project and do git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>
